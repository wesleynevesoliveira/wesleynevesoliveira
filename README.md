# :man_technologist: Wesley Neves Oliveira

## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wesley, I'm from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) and I'm 29 years old. I have a degree in Computer Science, interested in fullstack technology. I have been studying a lot about NodeJS and React, taking advantage of everything that wonderful Javascript has to offer, as I see a promising future for this stack with React Native on mobile. 

Would you like to find me?
